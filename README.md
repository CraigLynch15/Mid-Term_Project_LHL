# Predicting-Flight-Delays
## Authors: Sidharth Ambady, Jimmy Kha, Craig Lynch
Lighthouse labs midterm project:

Baseline Model:
 we're going to create a baseline by taking an average of all the different delays and group it by airport. And then we'll use this in our baseline model
 Assumptions Used:
  -> Utilised operating carrier based on assumption that logistics controlled by the operating carrier thus is tied to the delay
